# CRKBD Keymap #

A keymap with a focus on software development. Symbols are provided on a layer in a way to try to make all programming symbols as easily accessible as possible.

- I currently am not using the outer columns as I don't like stretching my pinky.
- F1 to F10 keys are not yet mapped as I hardly use them. Should I find a need, I'll make them activate with tapdance on the number keys.
- I've added a ColemakDH layer as I'm interested in trying it out.
